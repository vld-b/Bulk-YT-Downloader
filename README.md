# Bulk-YT-Downloader
A python script made for downloading YT videos in bulk

# Prerequisities
A Python 3.12+ interpreter (might also work on lower versions like 3.10 or 3.9, but it's untested
pytube installed. You can do this with `pip install pytube` (Python interpreter required)

# Usage
## Works only on long form videos, not shorts
In a .txt (text) file, write all the video links, separating them by comma.
Then run the script with `python main.py` or an alternate way of your choice
Make sure the Python and text file are in the same folder
When asked to provide the text file, enter the text file's name along with its extension (example: thisIsATextFile.txt)
The script will download all the provided videos along with their thumbnails and put each combo in its own folder which's name is the video title.

# The script works so specifically because it was custom made for a friend
# Suggestions welcome
